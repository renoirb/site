By having a different email address for\nevery service or provider we interact with, we can effectively manage our online\npresence and minimize the risk of spam. With services like ProtonMail and\nSimpleLogin, creating aliases is quick and easy. This way, if a service or alias\nstarts receiving spam, we can simply disable it and generate a new one.\n\nAs part of my alias strategy, I’ve adopted the Proton Pass format, which allows\nfor a random component alongside a designated name for the purpose. For example,\n`\u003Cservice\u003E.\u003Csomething random\u003E@alias.example.org`. To streamline the organization\nof these aliases, I’ve developed a Sieve script that automatically sorts\nincoming emails into appropriate folders.\n\n```\nrequire \"comparator-i;ascii-numeric\";\nrequire \"envelope\";\nrequire \"environment\";\nrequire \"fileinto\";\nrequire \"include\";\nrequire \"regex\";\nrequire \"relational\";\nrequire \"spamtest\";\nrequire \"variables\";\nrequire \"variables\";\n\n# BEGIN Copy-Pasta: This is recommended to be included in any custom sieve within Proton\n# Generated: Do not run this script on spam messages\nif allof (environment :matches \"vnd.proton.spam-threshold\" \"*\", spamtest :value \"ge\" :comparator \"i;ascii-numeric\" \"${1}\") {\n    return;\n}\n# END Copy-Pasta\n\n# BEGIN: Pigeon Hole\nif address :matches :domain [\"to\", \"cc\", \"bcc\"] \"alias.example.org\" {\n  if address :matches :localpart \"to\" \"*.*\" {\n    set \"local_part\" \"${1}\";\n    set :lower \"local_part\" \"${local_part}\";\n    set \"pigeon_hole\" \"${local_part}\";\n    # Create the mailbox if it doesn't exist and file the email into it\n    # Make sure Boxes folder exists\n    fileinto \"Boxes\";\n    fileinto \"Boxes\u002F${pigeon_hole}\";\n    # Proton ^^ doesn’t support `fileinto :create \"Foo\u002FBar\"`, instead give a parent, and tentatively try in pigeonhole\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis Sieve script effectively sorts incoming emails based on their alias\npattern. Emails with aliases like `amazon.aws111@alias.example.org` or\n`amazon.audible222@alias.example.org` are grouped under the \"Box\u002Famazon\"\ndirectory, while emails like `ebay.333@alias.example.org` are filed directly\ninto the \"Box\" directory.\n\nBy automating this organization process, I can maintain a clutter-free inbox and\nensure that important emails are readily accessible.\n\n[lessons-from-lastpass]:\n  https:\u002F\u002Fproton.me\u002Fblog\u002Flessons-from-lastpass\n  'Lessons from LastPass'\n",dir:"\u002Fblog\u002F2024\u002F03",path:"\u002Fblog\u002F2024\u002F03\u002Fmanaging-email-aliases-with-protonmail-automatic-sorting",extension:".md",slug:l,createdAt:m,updatedAt:m,category:k},coverImage:{toc:[],body:{type:g,children:[]},text:n},month:"03",next:{title:i,locale:f,path:"\u002Fblog\u002F2024\u002F03\u002Fmanaging-email-aliases-with-protonmail-and-simplelogin-to-sort-automatically-into-inbox-folders-based-local-part",slug:"managing-email-aliases-with-protonmail-and-simplelogin-to-sort-automatically-into-inbox-folders-based-local-part"},preamble:{toc:[],body:{type:g,children:[]},text:n},prettyfiedTemporalDate:{prettified:"Sunday, March 3, 2024",temporalDate:"2024-03-03"},prev:{title:"Porting all my content into a static-site",locale:f,path:"\u002Fblog\u002F2020\u002F09\u002Fporting-all-my-content",slug:"porting-all-my-content"},slug:l,year:"2024"}],fetch:[],mutations:void 0}}("text","element","p","\n","code","en-CA","root","https:\u002F\u002Frenoirboulanger.com\u002Fblog\u002F2024\u002F03\u002Fmanaging-email-aliases-with-protonmail-and-simplelogin-to-sort-automatically-into-inbox-folders-based-local-part\u002F","Managing Email Aliases with ProtonMail and SimpleLogin to sort automatically into inbox folders based local part","2024-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","projects","managing-email-aliases-with-protonmail-automatic-sorting","2024-10-24T19:43:51.731Z","")));
