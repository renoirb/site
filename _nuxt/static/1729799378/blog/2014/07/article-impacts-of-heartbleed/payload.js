Here is the full answers I gave to the questions.\n\n### What made Heartbleed such a tremendous threat?\n\nIt hit more than the epicenter of our whole Internet infrastructure, it proven\ntrue every sysadmin worst nightmare and on top of that, it impacted everybody.\n\n\u003Cabbr\u003EOpenSSL\u003C\u002Fabbr\u003E is so widely used (estimated 2\u002F3 of the web) that many\norganizations were impacted. This vulnerability has been introduced as a\nprogramming mistake for about 2 years. What gives the chills is that since the\nperson who is exploiting the fail do not need to be the \"man in the middle\" nor\nneed to gain terminal access to the servers, there are no traces left behind. We\ntherefore had no idea how much it was used and by who.\n\nIt's important to remember that the attacker couldn't know what data he would\nget either, or if he would get anything interesting at all. And if the \"good\nguys\" didn't know about heartbleed for so long, probably not many \"bad guys\"\ndid, either.\n\nIn consequence, the world had to make a major effort to update a lot of software\nand people to replace many passwords, but the major impact is probably more\npsychological: we don't know what was stolen and we don't know if there is\nanother \"heartbleed\" hidden in our servers.\n\nOn the bright side, the old advice we give to end users: change your password\noften, is still valid. This was a nuisance, for sure, but at least heartbleed\ndidn't change anything there.\n\n### Is there anything about the current computing landscape that made the threat greater than it might have been in the past?\n\nThe time it takes to gather infrormation through such vulnerability and the set\nof tools available today has increased dramatically. Ther are network port\nscanners, for instance, that can report with high 90-percent accuracy in less\nthan 10 minutes.\n\nWhen attackers gets insight of a vulnerability, its not hard to get the\ninformation they are searching for. In the case of heartbleed, it was as simple\nas searching for machines listening on TCP port 443 and keep a list of servers\nusing a given version of OpenSSL that is known to have the mistake. Not\nsomething hard to do at all for the attackers.\n\nTodays' computing landscape has better tools, but so the tools to crack them. A\nbetter solution is to strenghten the infrastructure and educate end users.\nOtherwise, the chain will remain as strong as its weakest link.\n\nIf there is a thing that our society should do more is to continue teaching sane\nprivacy techniques such as strong and varied passwords.\n\nHopefully we'll get to a point where companies would rely on \"harder to gain\"\ninformation than you mother maiden name or your date of birth.\n\n### What were the most important things that companies needed to do in the face of Heartbleed?\n\nCompanies that doesn't maintain adequate server management techniques and tools\nhad a lot of (manual) things to do.\n\nThe priority was to upgrade to the patched version all affected parts of the\ninfrastructure, ensure that all system that stores passwords gets new passwords\nas soon as possible.\n\nOf course, the issue had to be fixed as quickly as possible, and without\ninterrupting the services... or belating deliverables that they were already\nworking on.\n\nTherefore, one of the most appreciated thing a system admin has is a way to\nmanage his fleed of servers remotely.

Besides giving chills to\neverybody, what heartbleed did is a loud \"wake up\" call.\n\nIt is only a matter of time before we learn something else to arise. Computer\nsecurity is still based on \"hard enough to crack\" secrets and an accepted set of\nannoyances. This is where education and better automation tools are of great\nhelp. It'd ease the justification of existence, maintenance, and deployment of\nsuch measures to everybody.\n\n### How can companies best protect themselves and their customers moving forward?\n\nEducation, and automation; in that order. Its better to have a good answer\n—ideally quickly— than a quick wrong answer.\n\nI hope to see training about security practices more often. Its not the lack of\ntraining that is the problem, but the people to take time to learn the\ntechniques.
