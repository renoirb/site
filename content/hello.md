Hello!

My name’s <nuxt-link to="/about"> <span itemprop="givenName">Renoir</span>
<span itemprop="familyName">Boulanger</span> </nuxt-link>
<a href="https://renoirboulanger.com/about/"> </a> and in my spare time I enjoy
reading about systems engineering and also to contribute to open-source
projects.

I have been building websites for over <data value="18">eighteen</data> years
and had been filling different roles such as <em>Front-End</em> and
<em>Back-End</em> development, but also to <em>manage cloud clusters</em> and
<em>orchestration systems</em>.

You can get my resume from my website in either
<a href="/resume/detailed">detailed version</a>, or <a href="/resume">short
format</a>. There is also an
<a href="/cv" title="C.V. de Renoir Boulanger en français"> outdated version in
French that’s available </a> <span lang="fr"> (SVP, Utilisez la version
anglaise!) </span>. If you want to get in touch with me <em>for a position</em>,
please make sure to see if the opportunity wouldn’t conflict with my current
project. You can find my renewal date at the
<a href="/resume#availability"><em>top</em> of my resumé </a>.

You may also find me on
