      business, public sector and institutional clients through offices in
      Canada, the U.S. and 37 other countries.
    summary:
      At RBC, I served as a Senior Full-Stack Developer, leading the
      implementation of scalable modules for the RBC Omni platform (Online
      Business Banking). I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to
      deliver solutions aligned with business objectives. Noteworthy
      achievements include streamlining developer onboarding processes and
      enhancing legacy systems for improved performance and reliability.
    highlights:
      - Make implementation proposals driven by the requirements and agenda set
        by product owners and business analysts.
      - Build scalable and reusable modules by collaborating with other
        production teams, including the design system/platform team.
      - Rewritten new developer onboarding documentation and completely
        automated how to properly setup the current password to be used properly
        through Git and other scripting, including the Bank´s authoritative
        self-signed certificate that would cause many headaches.
    highlights.more:
      - Re-Implement and improve link manager to legacy application system. So
        that the HTML templates contains a “Link Id”, and how it dynamically
        creates an hidden form and properly redirects to legacy HTML views.
      - Revise and make migration strategies for my Squad’s Angular monorepo to
        use Jest and ESLint 7 along with Prettier with automated LintStaged
        commit hooks.
      - Implement advanced Angular data-driven patterns to guide my colleagues
        away from filling HTML templates and instead use classes to provide
        data. Including how to rewrite forms using FormGroups instead of
        template
      - Make module stubs for the Backend chapter to write Express.js middleware
        in isolation instead of from a monolith
      - Written extensive onboarding documentation taking into account how to
        properly and automatically adjust developer tools at every password
        change. Avoiding popular “Ignore this error” and rather use corporate
        signed TLS certificate right

    highlights:
      - Overhaul of the Software development team’s workspace setup, which
        allowed anyone to have exactly the same setup by invoking a few simple
        commands. A fresh computer would be ready after 1h instead of taking
        multiple days and asking around to other colleagues.

      to be the “the intersection of advertising, publishing and public
      relations, with storytelling and creativity at its core.”
    summary:
      As a Systems Delivery Blueprinting Specialist, I played a pivotal role in
      driving continuous delivery and deployment initiatives for
      Colloquial/Betastream projects. I designed and implemented robust cloud
      orchestration solutions, automating deployment processes across multiple
      cloud platforms. My contributions streamlined development workflows and
      enhanced project scalability and reliability.
    highlights:
      - Introduce and coach the team Continuous Delivery and Code release, and
        deployment system.
      - Plan, Review, and Build a next-generation infrastructure and deployment
        system for the project production pipeline.
    highlights.more:
      - Released a Cloud Orchestration solution using Salt Stack, running on
        Amazon AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure, where we can
        manage automatically Web Applications, deployment levels, build steps
        and dependencies consistently;
      - Introduced HashiCorp Vagrant workflow to automatically manage Web
        Developer’s PHP setup using VirtualBox and Canonical Ubuntu Linux 16.04
        LTS. By doing so, every developer got the same Web Server setup as in
        production;
      - Introduced automated packaging for every WordPress projects, by
        leveraging Composer’s archive feature. The automated build process would
        first pull all dependencies, run code-quality linters, and if
        successful, create a Zip archive. By merging on master on Bitbucket
        would generate an archive, and the continuous-delivery system make all
        web server nodes to download the archive, extract its contents in a
        folder. Deploying a release would be changing the “live” symbolic to the
        newly extracted package;
      - Introduced advanced Varnish caching with Fastly. Created HashiCorp
        Vagrant workspace network (e.g. one Web Server VM, one Database server,
        one Varnish VM) to allow working on Varnish VCL caching scripts.

        TimeSeries aggregation and visualization systems. The ideal system had
        to take into account the airtight networking policies which included
        corporate TLS certificate, and deployment targets would often be
        inaccessible to the Internet.
