  My new job is to contribute to the success of the WebPlatform project, a
  rapidly growing web development collaborative documentation website. I would
  even call it the Web developer's missing manual on the Internet.

In a recent post, I was explaining that [I resigned my
position][post-resigned-to-join-another].

The [new _exciting project_][post-on-webplatform-docs-blog] that I was referring
to is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304014419/http://www.webplatform.org/">WebPlatform</a> project at the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/10/webplatform.html.en">W3C</a>.</p>

For people who do not know what the W3C is, it is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web.

The WebPlatform project is a rapidly growing web development <a href="https://webplatform.github.io/docs/WPD/Community">collaborative documentation website</a>.

> I would even call it the Web developer's missing manual for web developers to build quality web applications using the latest techniques.

As for the sponsors, it is backed by well known companies, that we refer to as
[stewards](https://web.archive.org/web/20130328132045/http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/),
such as [Adobe][wbm-steward-adobe],
[Google](https://web.archive.org/web/20130404094726/http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/google),
[Mozilla](https://web.archive.org/web/20140304140402/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:MDN_content_on_WebPlatform.org),
and Microsoft to name a few.

<rb-notice-box variant="info" class="my-5">
  <strong slot="header">The <del>sponsors</del> <ins>stewards</ins> were...</strong>

Since 2015, the site has stopped receiving funding, we can see a note:

> The WebPlatform project, supported by various stewards between 2012 and 2015,
> has been discontinued. ([...](https://webplatform.github.io/))

For context: I worked from 2013, up to the end when the sponsors retracted.
Notes about what I’ve done is in
[leaving W3C](/blog/2015/07/leaving-w3c#in-retrospective)

For the sake of completeness, here is the list of the sponsors as they were on
the public website:

- [Adobe][wbm-steward-adobe]
- Apple
- [Facebook](https://web.archive.org/web/20130212083250/http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/facebook/)
- [Google](https://web.archive.org/web/20130212083254/http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/google/)
- [HP](https://web.archive.org/web/20130806182941/http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/hp/ 'HewlettHewlett-Packard, HP Inc.')
- [Intel](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116171710/http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/intel/)
- [Microsoft](https://web.archive.org/web/20130806125714/http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/microsoft/)
- [Mozilla](https://web.archive.org/web/20130718224134/http://www.webplatform.org:80/stewards/mozilla/)
- [Nokia](https://web.archive.org/web/20130808004756/http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/nokia/)
- [Opera](https://web.archive.org/web/20130213053724/http://webplatform.org/stewards/opera/)
- [W3C](https://web.archive.org/web/20131204185043/http://www.webplatform.org/stewards/w3c/)

Later on, HP stopped providing hosting and DreamHost graciously helped us.

</rb-notice-box>

I will contribute to the site as a Developer Operations engineer. My work will
be basically to enhance the features and manage the server infrastructure of the
site as much as continuing what [I already do as a _hobbyist_
speaker][post-one-of-my-first-talks].

Roughly, it consist of everything I always did or dreamed of:

- Work on a flagship site with heavy traffic usage, with and for respected
  professionals around all the world
- Use my favourite operating system and tools in System Administration
- Technical liaison with Open-source communities
- Develop and maintain the community platform, with web development, ensuring
  application performance, and implement continuous deployment
- Speak and participate at conferences related to web standards
- Contribute to [moving the web forward](https://movethewebforward.org/),
  full-time (!)

If you are living in Montreal and you would like me to share with you on how to
participate in this exciting project, ~~just send me an e-mail and I’ll gladly
answer~~.
