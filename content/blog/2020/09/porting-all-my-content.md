[monorepo-related-alpha]:
  https://github.com/renoirb/experiments-201908-rush-typescript-just-bili-monorepo
  'TypeScript monorepo using Rush.js, with a few packages, some depending on each other, and tests'
[monorepo-particles]:
  https://gitlab.com/renoirb/renoirb-particles/
  'Renoir’s particles'
[archivator]: http://www.archivator.site/ 'Archivator project'
[archivator-repo]: https://github.com/renoirb/archivator/tree/v3.x-dev
[archivator-npmjs]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/archivator

It’s been more than ten years that I haven't touched my site and I want to
make-use of my skills working with Vue.js and modern Front End of the last years
back to my own profit.

So this is going to be a complete port of all my previous content, talk slides,
experiments, posts, Twitter feed, examples, code bits all in a static site.

It's still work in progress, at the moment `https://renoirb.github.io/site/` is
the live version of my site that'll replace `https://renoirb.com/` and
`https://renoirboulanger.com`.

I should piggy-back using my own public packages such as my [Monorepo related
content][monorepo-related-alpha], [my "_Particles_" monorepo
project][monorepo-particles], along with archiving my thousands of web browser
tabs by leveraging my [Archivator][archivator] ([_archivator_ package on
NPM][archivator-npmjs]).

This is just something I've jotted down quickly so that It explains what's this
for.

Keep in touch!
