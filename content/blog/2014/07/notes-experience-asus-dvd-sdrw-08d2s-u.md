  Dear chief of marketing at ASUS. This is me, a web developer, who’s giving
  some feedback about my purchase and first contact an ASUS product.
---

<p>How do you feel when you purchase a tech product from a respected brand and it feels sketchy and you figure out, after receiving the desired piece of hardware that it doesn’t fit at all.</p>

<p>What got me even more disappointed is the fact I went through product reviews, read tech specs, shopped around for other products and decided to give a chance.</p>

<p>Before getting in the depth of the topic; I’d like to apologize for the tone of this message. My “gage of good will” (ref: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758">Steve Krug</a> ) is very low and I hope this gets somewhere so it can become an incentive to improve the site and product support medias.</p>

<p><em>NOTE</em> I have (some) theoretical knowledge about User-Interaction design due to my numerous conversations on the topic with relatives and professional contacts who are in the field of software ergonomics. Its in the spirit to remove pain-points that i'm outlining them. Since I spent some time writing this essay, i decided to also share it on my site.</p>

<h2>0. The product</h2>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SDRW-08D2S-U-150x150.jpg" alt="img" title="ASUS SDRW-08D2S-U in all its glory" id="SDRW-08D2S-U" class="alignright size-medium pull-right" /> My original expectation wasn’t very big. I wanted a lightweight, small DVD recorder for my backups. You know, to store files you do not need often. I also wanted to encode what I’m burning on disc so if I ever have to let go of the disc, i can be reassured that the data is not accessible without cracking it.</p>

<p>So, what I was expecting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Small</li>
<li>USB2 powered (only one cable)</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
</ul>

<p>My purchase was then a <a href="http://www.asus.com/Storage_Optical_Drives/SDRW08D2SU/">ASUS SDRW-08D2S-U</a></p>

<p>And supporting encryption got me close the deal. Sadly, ASUS didn’t do anything for Mac OS users.</p>

<p>The following are problems separated by scenarios I went through while getting acquainted with my new purchase.</p>

<h2>1. Product registration</h2>

<p>During product registration, it FORCED me to fill ALL fields, including my date of birth. If I do not want to give my underwear size besides my full name and region of the world I am at.</p>

<p>NOTE: After going to account, I could add what I wanted to disclose.</p>

<h2>2. Searching for drivers</h2>

<p>It says supports Mac OS right? After whipping the CD in my CD-Drive-less MacBook Pro I expected to see some (hopefully bloatware free) software to burn CDs and enjoy the CD crypto offering (more on this later). I found nothing.</p>

<p>I know Mac OS and the underlying BSD architecture has us no need to install any drivers. But since the package said it supported and provided software, I thought I could see if I install them. But found none.</p>

<p>After this, i went the asus.com. Its nice looking, marketing flash Pizzazzz. But not useful.</p>

<p>Its only after 10 minutes searching the site, only finding how to compare another product to buy and cannot find appropriate way to navigate to product, downloads/drivers. I got only promotional navigation. This makes the human who purchased something frustrated.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that I had to use a search engine that is NOT from asus.com (in useful results, again). Found plenty of other places to buy and <a href="http://support.asus.com/faq/detail.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;p=2&amp;m=SDRW-08D2S-U&amp;s=10&amp;hashedid=vinKDnObEKvp2AnW&amp;os=&amp;no=365B1762-61C4-5102-77A7-3B63610A1BE2#">then I found that page where I made this comment</a> by using the comment form at the bottom.</p>

<p>The fact that the page had no images made me think of two things; one more detail that makes it look sketchy, and that maybe the page has outdated information and therefore would not apply to my case.</p>

<h2>3. Disc Encryption</h2>

<p>Now that I spent some more time explaining all this, I am very disappointed by the product because it sells crypto, but I guess only under Windows.  My last resort will be to create MacOS native encoded DMG files, then burn them. No thanks to ASUS. :(</p>

<h2>5. Y-shaped USB</h2>

<p>Really?</p>

<p>That’s a first time.  I understand the electrical needs and the fact that many laptop USB outlets doesn’t always feed with enough voltage/amps. I was surprised.</p>

<p>I saw NO reviews about this.</p>

<h2>6. Reading the manual</h2>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/full-text-ikea-instructions-235x300.jpg" alt="img" title="IKEA Instructions are word less, let’s have a middle ground" class="size-medium pull-right" /> I saw NO reviews about this. The interesting part is that, unlike most people, I actually read the manual and it was a pain to figure out which boxes was in my own language.</p>

<p>It was basically me skipping each boxes, in case it was in either french or english. Just to realize after flipping the full “map” around that I just needed to plug the cable.</p>

<p>Good manuals doesn’t require long text. Have a look at how IKEA deals with multi-lingual instructions.</p>

<h2>4. Conclusion</h2>

<p>Needless to say that i’m disappointed by the purchase. But in the end, I have a not too big/clumsy, device that I can use to read and burn DVDs.</p>

<p>I really hope that ASUS gears toward improving their software products.</p>
