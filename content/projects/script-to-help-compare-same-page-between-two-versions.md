It’s a tool to help compare pages of the same Web site before a major code upgrade:

- To make sure All URLs OK (or at least as much as possible — [Cool URIs Do Not Change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI))
- Allow comparing the same page, even when a page changed URL on the new version

To allow us quickly flip through files, compare visually, and take notes.
